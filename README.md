# vasoPrimaverile

This is the same as Presepe-1.0 but with different colors and effects

sketch to control a strip of WS2812B with Ardino UNO or Nano

Requires: FastLED 3.1.0 library

Arduino circuit is really simple.
Connect the strip of WS2812B to 5V, GND and D3 pin.

### This code is to be built with Atom+PlatformIO
### FastLED library is included in lib folder
(I have to understand how to use libraries installed inn standard Arduino library)
